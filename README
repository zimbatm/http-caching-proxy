==================

`curl http://your-cache-host.herokuapp.com/http://foobar.com/path/to/package.tar.gz`

INSTALL
-------

```bash
heroku create --buildpack git://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go.git
heroku config:add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=somekey AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=some-secret-key S3_BUCKET_NAME=http-cache-test
git push heroku master
```

TODO
----

Add support for environment variables as setting to avoid exposing the
AWS keys in the logs.

S3 doesn't support Transfer-Encoding: chunked for upload which is injected
by Go if the Content-Length header is not set.

Support cache invalidation

Don't use the Scheme in the S3 path

Use Multi-Part uploads for big files

Add signed urls support to S3
